# Note-Taking App

## Project Goals

I used Ajax to make GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE requests, creating a one-page application in the process.

My application is a note-taking app. It displays a list of all your notes and has the ability to create new notes, edit old notes, and delete notes. Notes are made up of a title, text, and the date/time most recently updated.
